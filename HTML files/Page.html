            <p style="color: rgb(245, 16, 73)"> Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.
                The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially.
                The British philosopher Alain de Botton suggests that we simply share meals with those who disagree with us:
                “Sitting down at a table with a group of strangers has the incomparable and odd benefit of making it a little more difficult to hate them with impunity. Prejudice and ethnic strife feed off abstraction. However, the proximity required by a meal – something about handing dishes around, unfurling napkins at the same moment, even asking a stranger to pass the salt – disrupts our ability to cling to the belief that the outsiders who wear unusual clothes and speak in distinctive accents deserve to be sent home or assaulted. For all the large-scale political solutions which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to eat supper together.”
                Perhaps it is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity increases, so does understanding. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln's quote, “I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.”
                Facts don't change our minds. Friendship does.

                <p> PERFACE
                    I’D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN WHY THE ALCHEMIST is a symbolic book, whereas. The Pilgrimage was a book of non-function.
                    For eleven years of transforming metals into gold, or of discovering the Elixir of life, was too fascinating to pass unnoticed by someone coming face-to-face with magic for the first time.
                    I confess that the Elixir of life was what attracted me most. Before I heard and felt the presence of God, the idea of everything one day coming to an end used to drive me to despair. So when I learned of the possibility of finding a liquid that could prolong my life by many years. I decided to dedicate myself, body and soul, to making it.
                    Those were times - in the early 70s – of great social upheaval, and no serious works on alchemy had been published in Brazil. Like the two characters in the book. I started to spend what little money I had on buying imported books, and devoted many hours every day to studying their complicated symbolism. I tracked down two or three people in Rio de Janeiro who were seriously involved in the Master Work, but they refused to see me. I met many others who called themselves alchemists, people who had their own laboratories and promised to teach me the secrets of the Art in exchange for absolute fortunes. Today, I realize that they knew nothing about what they pretended to teach.
                    All my efforts were in vain. Nothing happened; none of those events were reported in the published texts on alchemy. Books written in such impenetrable language, full of symbols, dragons, lions, suns, moons, and quicksilver. The symbolism allowed such a wide range of uncertainty that I always felt I was following the wrong path. In 1973, desperate at my failure to make any progress, I committed a supremely irresponsible act. At the time I was working for the state, giving lectures on drama, and I decided to set my students exercises relating to the Emerald Tablet.
                    This action, and other incursions into the murkier areas of magic in the following year, led me to experience, in flesh and blood, the truth of the proverb, “As you sow, so shall you reap”. My whole life was in ruins. For the next six years I was quite sceptical   about anything to do with mysticism. During this time in spiritual exile, I learned many important things: that we only accept a truth after we have first wholeheartedly rejected it; that we mustn’t run away from our own destiny; and what the hands of God is firm, but infinitely generous.
                    In 1981 I met RAM and my Teacher, who led me back to the road I am destined to travel. And as he introduced me to his beliefs, I went back to studying alchemy on my own. We were talking one night, after a long telepathic session, and I asked him why alchemists always use such vague, complicated language.
                    My Teacher said, “There are three types of alchemist: those who are vague because they don’t know what they’re doing; those who are vague because they do know what they’re doing, but who also know that the language of alchemy is addressed to the heart and not to the mind.”
                    “And the third type?”
